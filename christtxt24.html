<P><B>These past two years have had their share of ups and downs, but God is good, He knows what is going on and gives us strength and peace to persevere.  With six grandkids garnering our attention, most of our travel excursions have been to get our fix on them (and of course their parents); two grandkids here in Reno, two in Pahrump, NV, and two in San Diego, CA (with one major change during this period to the Pahrump family).   Two of four sons reside in Reno and we get to enjoy their presence pert near daily, at the time expense of the other two sons; fortunately, we have the internet and smart phones to stay very closely attached. </B></P>

<P><B>Perhaps the biggest change of our extended family is that Little Bear (6ft 4in), John Bear Ross II, turned his eyes to attending college here in Reno.  Part of that big change was moving in with us during that pursuit, residing with us for just over two years.  He has: turned 21, married his childhood sweetheart Faith, moved out, and is now an employee at the Tesla plant just east of Reno working 12 hour / work-day shifts.  Yes, we have a 21-year-old grandson, and therefore we must be well up in the years, yes indeed, so true, everyday getting closer to being face to face with Jesus (or perhaps we will be on our knees!).  We had the honor of attending the Pahrump High School graduation ceremony of Little Bears younger sister, Olivia.  She is now pursuing college courses, almost all on-line, a not-so-great result of changes resulting from COVID.  Big John, John Bear Ross I, continues employment at the Nevada Test Site, and continues a pursuit of writing.  He has submitted the final draft of the 3rd novel to his Junctionworld trilogy, a sci-fi multi planet mech tale (see his first two books on Amazon), and designing (lots of computer work), and creating (with his own 3d printer) with incredible detail, and selling to some extent, miniature mechs, anywhere from 1-10 inches tall.  His bride Rachel, fills her days by managing a very quaint used book store and loving her man and their kids.</B></P>

<P><B>Trips to San Diego by us, trips to Reno by the San Diegans; always a good time.  Big highlight for me this year was to go on an official dress-up date with 11-year-old Mia, corsage and everything.  After a Macaroni Grill dinner, we were off to a concert to see The Five Browns, all adult siblings, each playing their own piano, all pretty much as the same time; twas a very memorable concert to me and young Mia who has been taking piano lessons these last several years; that is, when she can squeeze her practicing in between the many soccer events for which she is one of the top players of her traveling team.  Her younger brother Jude (6 years old) also a very good soccer player.  He is very rambunctious and we pray for him that his knees survive all the hard landings he seems to enjoy.  He is doing well in the Spanish immersion elementary school.  He took Halloween very seriously; his costume was a military man, and, going all in, he shaved all his curly locks off for the first time in his life.  Mark no longer manages a single San Diego public swimming pool, cuz he now  manages all the people who work at those San Diego pools and is well respected for the actions he has taken.  Keri continues the very serious nurse position in the NICU.  She, Mark, and Mia had fun coaching Jude and his soccer team.</B></p> 

<P><B>Matthew resigned his Coffee Bar employment to become a member of Costco.  He is doing very well there and seems to be appreciated and respected by many.  His church volunteer duties continue in the audio/video booth.  His birthday is late Oct, Luke’s is early Nov.  So, once a year we have father/son day in-between those two dates.  Normally take in a couple meals, hit the putt-putt golf, do an escape room, then on to 18 holes of golf, topped off by a movie in theaters,  a very fun day.  Given our lack of skill (except for Luke) our golf rules are very lax, for instance, while in the world would I apply a penalty just because my golf ball ends up (frequently) in the adjacent fairway, just makes no sense.  He is fairly nerdy, evidenced by ordering separately all the various internal components and building his own powerful computer.  And, on the cutting edge, he is leasing a fully electric Subaru vehicle.</B></p>

<P><B>On the other end of the grand-child age spectrum is 2-year-old Emery Joy, sister to 4-year-old Isla Rose, two beautiful children of Luke and Lauren.  Their Dada Luke, works out of a home office for Hughes (emergency safety showers, etc) as the western US sales rep.  His bride Lauren is a nurse in pediatric oncology at a local hospital.  Takes a very special compassionate person to perform the nursing duties both she and Keri do.  Given that we live in the same city, we get the pleasure of baby-sitting their two young-uns.  One of my favorite outings with the 4yo and 2yo grandkids is to park at the end of Reno International Airport and watch their excitement as they spot the jet airliner way off in the distance (much better eyes than mine) and track it (and vigorously wave) as it passes directly over our heads seemingly very close.  Luke and Lauren were able to take a wonderful cruise ship in Jan touring the west coast of central America.</B></p>  

<P><B>On a sad note, Louise’s younger sister, Judy, died in Yuma in Jan 2023.  Her departure left a void in the hearts and actions of many.  One of a multitude of favorite memories, is her wild claim that a fun trip to a San Diego (she lived in Yuma) with us resulted in a very humorous claim that she was pushed over by her sister Louise at dusky hours onto the sandy beach getting just a bit wet from the waves waning and waxing (we have the video and the resulting laughter of all proving the facts though). Through it all, a very positive result, is a closer and more frequent communication with her remaining sister.</B></p>  

<P><B>And, Henry Dale Holmes, husband to my mother for 20 years, is now with the Lord as of 7 March 2024 at age 93.  He and I both enjoyed my weekly visits, most of the time going on some driving outing in the Reno area.</B></p> 

<P><B>Louise, always the excellent master chef, cooks up delicious creations in our new Traeger smoker.  We enjoyed a short river boat cruise in the Sacramento area, followed by a wonderful Josh Groban concert at a huge facility out in the middle of nowhere an hour or so north of Sacramento.  Add in a visit to Fly Geyser, amazingly included as one of the, 25 must-visit hidden gems from across the US, in a Youtube video.  I had screws put in my left shoulder in Sep to match the screws in my right shoulder, so now, both shoulders and both knees have metal parts – pretty much a titanium guy taken care of by a wonderful bride.  Still the church librarian.  Louise and I still teaching weekly AWANA to children.  Yet another season pass for 8 games of TripleA minor league baseball.  Still anxiously expecting that trumpet call (I Thess 4:16).  Loving life, we remain</B></p>
