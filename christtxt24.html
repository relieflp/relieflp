</b><p><b>The following represents somewhat of a departure from the usual clever, witty, incredibly interesting yearly novel of Feiler family happenings.  Life has slowed down a bit so the effort this year (covering two years) presented in an abbreviated format.  Our family composition at this time is Louise and me, four sons, three daughter-in-loves, and six grandchildren age ranging from 2 months to 19 years.  Precious are times we have spent with them.  We have loved our long-distance visits mainly to/fro the Pahrump and San Diego gangs.  The local folks (Matthew, and Luke, Lauren, Isla, and now brand new (18 Nov) Emery Joy), we see very frequently.  Except for the nuisance of the COVID experience, life for Louise and me continues at a very pleasant rate.</b></p>

</b><p><b>Pahrump group.  John: now for many years, working as mill wright at the Nevada Test Site keeping his eyes open for other opportunities; working on the 3rd novel of the Junctionworld trilogy.  Now 19, John “Little” Bear (6’4”) graduated high school in 2021, moved in with us in Fall 2022 to attend college here in Reno; welcomed him to Reno by taking him to the Hot Air Balloon Festival, the Reno Air Races, etc ; he is doing well (straight A’s the first semester).  Olivia, now a high school junior and doing well, racking up her driving hours required for legal behind-the-wheel solo trips.</b></p>

<p><b>San Diego group.  Mark/Keri: continue to make some very incredible improvements to their house and property, quite the plant gurus, and now the owners of four egg-producing chickens.  Mia, in a Spanish immersion school, excelling in piano, soccer, etc.  We spent a month with them helping out as Mark recovered from some toe surgery.  Mark continues employment with the city maintaining community swimming pools; Keri continues as nurse in the NICU department.  Firecracker Jude got his first haircut, but retains his strength and exuberance.</b></p>

<p><b>Matthew shifted from barista employment and now enjoys his Costco employment.  He continues to execute audio/video duties at our church.</b></p>

<p><b>Luke and Lauren added to their family with the joyous birth of Emery Joy Feiler last month (18 Nov 2022).  Luke works water safety engineering duties with Hughes (requiring a bit more travel as the west coast “guy”); Lauren, enjoying three months of maternity leave, before returning as nurse in pediatric oncology.  Isla Rose, now two, is a weekly babysitting enjoyment we heartily cherish.</b></p>

<p><b>Constants keep our life fairly steady and predictable to include frequent church activities, Isla babysitting, one to two visits/week caring for my 92-year-old step-father (Dale Holmes), skiing 4-5 days per year, 8-game yearly passes for our local Reno Aces minor league baseball team (feeds the Arizona Diamondbacks) . . . . . .</b></p>
		  
<p><b>We both tested positive to COVID but given our vaccinations, our symptoms were very minor.  We’ve had our fair share of medical events to include big events of cataract eye surgery for Louise and a Total Knee Replacement of my other knee (right knee in Sep 2020, left in May 2022).  We scheduled our medical issues so we could tackle a major effort of replacing wall to wall carpet with wood flooring.</b></p>  

<p><b>We love living in Reno and enjoy the four seasons, although it seems like “Fall” lasts only a couple weeks.  We had a 14” snow dump (at our house) in early December with much greater depths in the mountain ski resorts (I got one day in already).  God has blessed us with over 38 years of wedded bliss!!!!!

<p><b>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.    John 3:16-18</b></p>
